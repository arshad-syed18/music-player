# Audio Player App

## Accomplished Tasks:
- Users can upload audio files (e.g., MP3) using the built-in browser API.
- The uploaded audio files are stored locally using the browser's storage mechanism.
- The app displays a playlist and a "now playing" view.
- Users can play any file from the playlist, and playback continues to the next file upon completion.
- Upon reloading the page, the app loads the last played audio file.
- The app utilizes the standard built-in HTML audio player for playback.

## Limitations:
- Due to browser limitations, storing more than 2 audio files (or more than 5mb) in local storage can result in exceeding storage quotas. This can lead to errors or unexpected behavior when attempting to store additional files.

## Conclusion:
All the requirements were successfully accomplished in the Audio Player app.
